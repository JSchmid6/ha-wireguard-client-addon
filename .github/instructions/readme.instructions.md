# README Instructions

## Convention
- The README is written in **English**.
- It is user-facing documentation for Home Assistant users.
- Include installation steps, configuration examples, and feature descriptions.
- Configuration examples should use YAML format matching the `config.yaml` schema.
- Never include real private keys or secrets in examples — use placeholder values like `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY`.
